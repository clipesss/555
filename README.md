# WebAssembly Test Project

Welcome to the WebAssembly Test Project! This project is compiled from C++ (.cpp) to WebAssembly (.wasm). It serves as a demonstration to understand how WebAssembly works, without using a database.

## About the Project

This project is a simple yet powerful demonstration of using C++ code compiled to WebAssembly. It showcases how you can bring native code performance to web applications. The main goal is to provide a clear and concise example of WebAssembly in action.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can download this repository and host it on GitHub Pages to see how it looks and works in a web environment.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- Emscripten SDK (for compiling C++ to WebAssembly)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/WebAssemblyTestProject.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd WebAssemblyTestProject
    ```
3. **Compile the project:**
    ```sh
    put it on your gitgub pages
    ```
